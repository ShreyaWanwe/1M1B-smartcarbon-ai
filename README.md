# ðŸŒ± SmartCarbon AI - Intelligent Carbon Accounting System

Transform weeks of manual carbon accounting into minutes of automated processing.

## Vision
SmartCarbon AI automates emissions data capture, calculates carbon footprints using industry-grade emission factors/APIs, and produces AI-driven recommendations and compliance-ready reports, enabling organizations to move from fragmented spreadsheets to a trusted, auditable carbon accounting workflow.

## The Problem
- 90% of companies struggle with accurate emissions data collection.
- Only ~45% report Scope 3 emissions, which represent ~60% of global emissions.
- Manual processing of invoices, energy bills, and operational records is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Multiple reporting standards (GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, CDP, TCFD) make compliance complex.

## Our Solution
AI-powered document processing integrated with industry carbon-calculation APIs and Google Gemini for context-aware insights.

## Core Features
- **Intelligent Document Processing**
  - Multi-format support (PDF, scanned images), batch uploads, 15+ languages.
  - OCR + context-aware extraction to reliably capture amounts, units, costs, dates.
- **Gemini API Integration**
  - Context-aware extraction and multilingual processing without translation loss.
- **Multi-Standard Compliance**
  - Automated checks and mapping for GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, CDP, and TCFD.
- **Real-Time Insights**
  - AI-generated, prioritized recommendations for emission reduction and high-impact actions.
- **Dashboards**
  - Interactive charts (Plotly) for category breakdown, timelines, and compliance readiness.
